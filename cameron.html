			<h3>BOH Sungai Palas Tea Plantation</h3>

			<br>

			<p>No visit to Cameron Highlands is complete without visiting the vast tea plantations. Thanks to its fertile valleys and cool climate, the British realised that this was ideal for planting tea, even developing the area into a hill resort in 1925. Now, it is the leading tea-growing region in Malaysia.  It’s easy to imagine yourself in a different country as you stand in the middle of this majestic sea of green. Rustling tea leaves form Mexican waves with every brush of the wind. Some of the usual haunts include the BOH Tea Plantation, Bharat Tea Plantation and Boh Sungai Palas Tea Centre. Be sure to take photos and have a cuppa while you are here.</p></font>

			<h3>Strawberry Farm Cameron Highland</h3>

			<p>Cameron Highlands is one of the only places in Malaysia that grows strawberries all year round. When this dainty fruit is in season from May to August, you are allowed to enter the farm and pluck your own strawberries. You would want to try them fresh off the farm, with a dollop of cream on the side. Strawberry is also in everything here, from ice cream to jam, milk shake, juice, waffles and even strawberry with chocolate fondue – an absolutely delight if you are a fan of strawberries.  Well-known strawberry farms you can add to your list include Big Red Strawberry Farm, Kok Lim Strawberry Farm and Raju Hill Strawberry Farm.</p>

			

			<h3>Lavender Garden Cameron Highland</h3>

			<p>Malaysians don’t get to see lavenders often, so this garden is an opportunity to admire lavender blooms, as well as other colorful flowers. If you have seen lavenders abroad, then you might find the garden smaller than expected.

There is a café selling lavender or strawberry soft serve ice cream, coffee, tea and little snacks. The entrance fee is RM10 for adults.</p>
