<p>The Rawa Slide is one of the best attractions on the island and that is not unusual, considering it is a fun giant slide that provides you with a just-enough adrenaline rush before you land straight into the clear blue waters.There are no other better chances to unleash your inner child within than going on the Rawa Slide. It may look scary for first-timers don’t worry, it’s actually safe but once you try it, you would probably want more though!.</p>
